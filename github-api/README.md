## Build a User Search Application with the GitHub API

Create a simple web app (using `ReactJs` + `Redux`) with `a live search field` that filters users from the `Github Users API` and then `lists those users in a table`.
(Github API Doc : https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/search#search)

When a user enters at least 3 characters into the text field, make an API request to the github endpoint, parse the resulting JSON and display the following pieces of data for the first hundred user items .足

- avatar_url : The Github user avatar (rendered as an image)足
- login: The username of the github user足
- type: The type of user.足
- score: A decimal value representing the accuracy of the result against the search term.

When an active HTTP request is in progress, place a progress indicator anywhere on the page to indicate network activity. Once the search is performed, clearing the input should also clear the list of users displayed before.

NOTE: The Github API is rate limited. Performing too many requests too quickly will end with the user's API requests being blocked for a short period of time.

## Solution

#### Architecture

![alt text](./public/search-app-arch.png "Title")

##### Input Field UI

- Handles user input (React)

##### Results UI (Table)

- Receives results from State Management (Redux) and presents them to the user.

##### Status UI

- Displays the status of the request or any network errors.

##### Cache

Uses an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache to store the results of previous queries so that the controller can check the cache before sending a request to the server.

##### State Controller

- Acts as the central component where all other components interact.
- Passes user input and results between components.
- Fetches results from the server if the cache is empty for a particular query.

#### State Management

The code utilizes Redux Store and React State to manage the application's behavior and data flow:

- query [React State]: This state keeps the current search string as the user types in the search input.
- usersStore [Redux Store]:
  - `loading`: Tracks the status of the current request (in-progress, done).
  - `users`: Stores the successfully retrieved users, transformed from raw data.
  - `error`: Stores any error messages if there are issues during the request process.

#### Completed Cases:

- Minimum Query Length: To avoid irrelevant results, the search should trigger only when the query has a minimum length, typically 3 or more characters.

- Debounce Duration: Debouncing limits the number of API calls by ensuring the backend search API is called only after a delay (e.g., 300ms) following the last user input.

- Handle Race Conditions: Use AbortController to cancel previous requests before making new ones to avoid race conditions.

- Using Virtualized List: When the results contain a large number of items (hundreds or thousands), use a virtualized list to maintain performance and reduce memory usage.

- UX Considerations: Provide user feedback when the GitHub API rate limit is exceeded and auto-retry the request if the wait time to reset the quota is 3 seconds.

#### Potential Enhancements:

- Lazy Load Images: delays the loading of images until they are actually needed.

- Pagination/Sorting/Filtering: Implement these features to manage and display more data efficiently in the table.

- Improved UI/UX: Show a countdown for retrying requests after exceeding the quota limit.

- Integration/End-to-End Testing: Write tests to ensure the entire application works as expected.

- Handle Long Strings: Manage long text in result items appropriately by truncating with an ellipsis or wrapping to prevent overflow.
